Learning means different things to different people, to some it means practising and doing, to others studying, and some observing and watching. To each his own, we all learn  in our own ways. 

To me learning is just a review process, taking stock of the past and looking to the future to improve even if its just by a small amount. 

My definition of learning: 

A review process where you aim to do and be better than you were before. 
*Notice I said better than you were before and not *yesterday*, usually we can't put an arbitry time value on when we will improve but it however happens over some time. 

My #1 key to learning: 

1. Know that you must learn. 
You must first know you need to learn, to learn. If a person feels there is nothing to learn that will likely make then unresponsive to learning....? 

**Learning** can be applied to:
*   Sports
*   Finance
*   Family
*   Fitness
*   Work
*   Parenting
*   Anything, you name it! 


Learning is applicable in all we do as humans and thus is a key part of our life experience. As a child learns to take its first steps we must continue that same attitude to learn continuously. 

I perosnally think life is zero sum. Particular to this topic meaning if you are not learning and therefore progressing then you are receeding. I will give a few examples below to further explain this. 

Some examples of things that

Sports: If you are not getting stronger, you are getting weaker
 the same way you are alwasy getting older and not younger... just a thought. 



In summary, **learning** is important. It is a key part of growth and progression. Learning keeps you up-to-date and even ahead of the curve..
